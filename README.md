# First in... Line?
My submission into PlayJam 5, as well as my first released game! The source code is here for a fun pokey-aroundy, but I can't guarantee anything in here is good practice. (It was initially made for a jam, after all).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://play.date/games/first-in-line). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy! (Note that scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source — for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)
